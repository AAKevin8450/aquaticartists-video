  - Users can now select 1-8 analysis types simultaneously
  - Added "Select All" / "Deselect All" convenience buttons
  - Video analysis creates separate jobs for each selected type
  - Image analysis returns aggregated results for all selected types
  - Validation ensures at least one analysis type is selected

[Technical Details]
Purpose: Improve user experience with multi-select analysis, real-time feedback, and proper timezone display

Multi-Select Implementation:
- Frontend: Changed <input type="radio"> to <input type="checkbox">
- Backend: Updated API endpoints to accept analysis_types array instead of single analysis_type string
- Video: Creates separate Rekognition jobs for each type (API limitation requires individual jobs)
- Image: Runs all analyses synchronously and aggregates results
- Graceful error handling: partial failures don't block successful analyses

Upload Progress Tracking:
- XMLHttpRequest provides xhr.upload.addEventListener('progress') events
- Calculates percentage: Math.round((e.loaded / e.total) * 100)
- Updates progress bar width, text content, and status message in real-time
- fetch() API doesn't support progress events, hence the switch to XHR

Timezone Conversion:
- Uses Python's zoneinfo module (Python 3.9+) with ZoneInfo('America/New_York')
- tzdata package required on Windows (Linux/Mac have IANA database built-in)
- Automatically handles EST/EDT transitions
- Fallback to manual UTC-5 offset if zoneinfo fails

[Category: Bug Fix / Infrastructure]
Fix API route trailing slash issue and update IAM policy with explicit Rekognition permissions

[Changes Made]
- Fixed history API route handler to use trailing slash (@bp.route('/') instead of @bp.route(''))
  - Resolves Flask routing issues with /api/history/ endpoint
  - Ensures proper URL matching for history listing endpoint
- Updated VideoAnalysisAppPolicy (IAM) from v1 to v2 with explicit permissions
  - Replaced wildcard rekognition:* with 31 specific action permissions
  - Added explicit permissions for all 8 video analysis types
  - Added explicit permissions for all 7 image analysis types
  - Added explicit permissions for face collection management
  - Follows AWS security best practice (principle of least privilege)
- Fixed file size reading order in upload.py to get size before S3 upload
  - Prevents file pointer issues during multipart uploads

[Files Modified]
- app/routes/history.py:11 - Changed route decorator from '' to '/' for proper trailing slash handling
- app/routes/upload.py:174-177 - Moved file.seek() operations before S3 upload call
- AWS IAM Policy: VideoAnalysisAppPolicy updated to v2 (via AWS CLI)

[Technical Details]
Purpose: Fix route registration bug and improve IAM security posture

IAM Policy Update:
- Before: Used rekognition:* wildcard (less secure, harder to audit)
- After: Explicit permissions for StartPersonTracking, GetPersonTracking, StartSegmentDetection, GetSegmentDetection, and 27 other operations
- Policy ARN: arn:aws:iam::676206912644:policy/VideoAnalysisAppPolicy
- Version: v2 (set as default)
- Attached to: user aa_vscode

Route Fix:
- Flask's route matching with empty string '' can cause trailing slash issues
- Using '/' explicitly ensures /api/history/ matches correctly
- All three history endpoints now properly registered:
  - GET /api/history/ (list jobs)
  - GET /api/history/<job_id> (get job details)
  - DELETE /api/history/<job_id> (delete job)

Testing Results:
✅ History API endpoint - Working after fix
✅ Video Segment Detection - Working with updated IAM policy
✅ Video Label Detection - Working
✅ File Upload - Working
❌ Video Person Tracking - AccessDeniedException (AWS account-level restriction, not IAM policy issue)

Note on Person Tracking:
Despite having correct IAM permissions (verified via IAM policy simulator showing "allowed"),
Person Tracking returns AccessDeniedException. This appears to be an AWS service-level or
account-level restriction that requires AWS Support enablement. All other video analysis
types work correctly.

[Known Issues]
- Amazon Rekognition Person Tracking requires AWS account enablement beyond IAM permissions
- May require contact with AWS Support or higher-tier account access

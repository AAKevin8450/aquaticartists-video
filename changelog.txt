Template Architecture:
- base.html provides common layout, navigation, and JavaScript imports
- Each template uses {% block content %} for page-specific content
- Consistent navigation bar across all pages
- Flash message support for user feedback

JavaScript Functionality:
- utils.js provides centralized API interaction functions
- Handles file uploads with progress tracking
- Manages async video job polling and status updates
- Provides reusable alert and notification helpers

CSS Features:

- Card-based layouts for content organization
- Custom scrollbars and hover effects
- Responsive grid layouts for analysis results

Testing:
- All routes now return 200 status codes
